To build, run `make`.

To clean up, run `make clean`.

### Assumptions:
Before running the code, make sure to read the `TESTING.md` that will instruct you on how to make sure that the `Results` directory is made to store log files.

If issues with disk space quota arise (e.g. maze neither solves nor runs out of moves), wait 15 or more minutes and try again.

Further assumptions are written in DESIGN.md.
