To build, run `make`.

To clean up, run `make clean`.

### Assumptions:
    Before running the code, should type `mkdir Results` in order to generate "Results" directory (if not already created).
    If issues with disk space quota arise (e.g. maze neither solves nor runs out of moves), wait 15 minutes and try again.
    Further assumptions written in DESIGN.md
